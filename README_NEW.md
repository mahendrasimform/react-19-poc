- **React 19 Solution**: Automatic optimization by the React compiler
- **Real-world Impact**: Less boilerplate, better performance by default

## 🔧 Code Examples

### Using the `use` Hook
```typescript
// React 19: Direct Promise consumption
const userData = useAsyncData(fetchUserData(userId));

// Automatic Suspense integration - no loading states needed
return <UserProfile user={userData} />;
```

### Enhanced Form Actions
```typescript
// React 19: Built-in form handling
const { state, submitForm, isPending } = useFormAction(updateUserAction);

// Automatic pending states and error handling
<Button disabled={isPending}>
  {isPending ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
</Button>
```

### Optimistic Updates
```typescript
// React 19: Immediate UI updates
const { submitWithOptimistic } = useOptimisticForm(posts, createPostAction);

// Show optimistic post immediately, rollback on error
submitWithOptimistic(formData, optimisticPost);
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Performance First**: Leveraging React 19's automatic optimizations
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, readable code with minimal boilerplate
- **User Experience**: Immediate feedback with optimistic updates
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
